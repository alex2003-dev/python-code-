‘Conscious practice is the only serious way to get better at what we do.’
___
 ‘1. Everyday notes that serve only as reminders of information; you can write them any way you want, they will go in the bin within a day or two.

 2. Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and contain essential information in a form that is constantly available. They are always kept in the same format in the same place - either in the reference system or, as if the text on them were already ready to print, in a note box.
 3. Project notes that relate to one specific project only. They are stored in a separate folder for the particular project and can be forgotten or archived after the project is completed.’
___
‘That's why the threshold for writing down an idea should be as low as possible, but it's equally important to work through those ideas within a day or two. A good sign that a note has gone unprocessed for too long is that you've stopped realising what you meant or it's started to seem trivial to you. In the first case, you've forgotten what the note was supposed to remind you of. In the second, you've forgotten the context that gave it meaning.’
___
Any attempts to trick yourself into working through external rewards (e.g., doing something nice after writing a chapter) are only short-term solutions; they don't involve creating a positive feedback loop. These are very fragile motivational constructs. Only if the work itself becomes the reward, the motivation and reward dynamic can become self-sustaining and drive the process forward on its own
___

If you leave them for later, there is a chance to find answers to questions right after writing them down or during routine activities to answer study questions.
___
Literary notes are a form of deliberate practice as it gives feedback on what we have understood and what we haven't, while trying to put into our own words the essence of something is at the same time the best approach to understanding what we read.
___
‘What really helps productive, useful learning is to connect a piece of information to as many meaningful contexts as possible, which is what we do when we connect our notes in the box to others.’ 
‘His training recommendations read almost like instructions for a notebox:
- Pay attention to exactly what you want to remember.
- Properly encode the information you want to retain. (This includes forming appropriate cues.)
- Practice remembering
- We learn something not only when we relate it to prior knowledge and try to understand its broader meaning (clarification of essence), but also when we try to retrieve that knowledge at different times (intervals) in dothercontexts (variation), ideally with chance (contextual interference) and with deliberate effort (information retrieval).
___
‘The real enemy of independent thinking is not external authority, but our inertia. The ability to generate new ideas has more to do with abandoning old thinking habits than with coming up with as many ideas as possible. For obvious reasons, I don't recommend ‘going outside the box’.
