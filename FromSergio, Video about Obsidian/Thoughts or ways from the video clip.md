The video clearly outlines their ways of outlining and taking notes after taking notes of books, etc. Instead of taking short and meaningless notes, he highlights sentences from the book itself. Soon when it comes time to tidy up a note, he will highlight much less text and remove all unnecessary text.
There is no one way to write good or bad notes, the way that suits you is the best way to keep those notes.
