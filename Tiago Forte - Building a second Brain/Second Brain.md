You see, all the content you consume
Online and through all the different kinds of media you have at your disposal isn’t
Useless. It’s incredibly important and valuable. The only problem is that you’re
Often consuming it at the wrong time.
___
Save your best thinking so you don’t have to do it again.
___
It’s time to acknowledge
That we can’t “use our head” to store everything we need to know and to
Outsource the job of remembering to intelligent machines.
___
There are four essential capabilities that we can rely on a Second Brain to
perform for us:
1. Making our ideas concrete.
2. Revealing new associations between ideas.
3. Incubating our ideas over time.
4. Sharpening our unique perspectives.
___
Knowledge asset is anything that can be used in the future to solve a problem, save
Time, illuminate a concept, or learn from experience.
___
Knowledge assets can come from either the external world or your inner
Thoughts. External knowledge could include:
Highlights: Insightful passages from books or articles you read
Quotes: Memorable passages from podcasts or audiobooks you listen to.
Bookmarks and favorites: Links to interesting content you find on the
Web or favorite social media posts.
Voice memos: Clips recorded on your mobile device as “notes to self.”
Meeting notes: Notes you take about what was discussed during meetings
Or phone calls.
Images: Photos or other images that you find inspiring or interesting.
Takeaways: Lessons from courses, conferences, or presentations you’ve
Attended.
___
Progressive Summarization is the technique I teach to distill notes down to their
most important points. It is a simple process of taking the raw notes you’ve
captured and organized and distilling them into a usable material that can directly
Inform a current project
Progressive Summarization takes advantage of a tool and a habit that we are all
intimately familiar with—highlighting—while leveraging the unique capabilities
of technology to make those highlights far more useful than anything you did in 
school.
___
Looking at the note above, can you see how those few highlighted sentences
Jump out and catch your eye? They convey the main message of this article in a
Highlydistilled form that takes just seconds to grasp. When I come across this note
In the future—while doing a search or browsing the notes within a folder — I’ll be
Able to decide in the blink of an eye whether this source is relevant to my needs.
___
The Archipelago of Ideas technique is a contemporary reinvention of the ageold practice of outlining—laying out the points you want to include up front, so
that when it comes time to execute all you have to do is string them together.
___
The outline can link to more detailed content—instead of trying to
Сram every last point onto the same page, you can link to both your own
Private notes and public resources on the web, which helps avoid
Overloading the outline with too much detail.
___
If we consider that these projects are
Our biggest investments of attention, it’s worth adding a little bit of structure to
How we start them. Here’s my checklist:
1. Capture my current thinking on the project.
2. Review folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes.
3. Search for related terms across all folders
4. Move (or tag) relevant notes to the project folder.
5. Create an outline of collected notes and plan the project.
___
Here are some questions I use to prompt this initial brainstorm:
What do I already know about this project?
What don’t I know that I need to find out?
What is my goal or intention?
Who can I talk to who might provide insights?
What can I read or listen to for relevant ideas?
___
All the steps of the CODE Method are designed to do one thing: to help you
put your digital tools to work for you so that your human, fallible, endlessly
Creative first brain can do what it does best. Imagine. Invent.
